The To-Do List Application is a Java program that allows users to manage their tasks by adding, listing, marking as completed, and removing tasks. Each task is uniquely identified by a dynamic ID system that reuses IDs of deleted tasks to maintain efficiency. The application features input validation and a user-friendly menu for seamless task management.
